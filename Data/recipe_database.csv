These will keep well in the freezer for several days  if they last that long.Note: You can make a half batch instead  but these are so good  you won't want to do that  especially as they keep so well. , 53.79, 1.84, 9.22, 45.67, 2.11, 100.0, 0.0

Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds then let the herbs seep in the warm olive oil while you prepare the artichokes.Prepare a large pot with an inch of water at the bottom and a steamer rack. Prepare the artichokes. Have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation  use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes  rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown. Use a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half. Use a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes. Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil  reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves  cut side down on the steam rack. Cover. Steam for 20 minutes or until you can easily pull off the outer leaves  and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife. The artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes  as you will be cooking them further on the grill.Prepare your grill for direct  high heat. Toss the artichokes in the garlic  lemon and thyme infused oil coating liberally. Sprinkle artichokes with salt and pepper. Place the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates. Cover  and grill for 5 to 10 minutes  until you have nice grill mark on the cut sides of the artichokes. , 8.58, 7.57, 100.0, 71.01, 6.93, 72.34, 0.0
