Heat 1T butter and 1T oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and the white and light green pieces of scallion. Sauté about a minute. Add the cauliflower to the pan. Stir to coat with oil  then spread out in pan and let sit; you want it cook a bit and to caramelize (get a bit brown)  which will bring out the sweetness. After a couple of minutes  stir and spread out again. Add cold rice (it separates easily  so it won't clump up during cooking)  plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and  again  spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom. Let it sit for about two minutes—so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy. Add the peas and broccoli and stir again. Drizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat. Add chopped scallion tops and toss.I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw  chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.Season to taste with salt and  if you'd like  more soy sauce.
