The water should be hot to the touch but not hot enough to burn you. Process the almonds in a food processor until coarse almond meal is formed. Add the pecans and process until they are ground up into a coarse meal as well. Drain the dates and use your hand to squeeze out excess water. Add the drained dates  cocoa powder  vanilla extract  agave nectar  and salt to the food processor. Process until a smooth paste forms. Use a tablespoon measure to help you form the truffles. Pack a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the tablespoon measure  really pack it in there. Use your fingers to slide the half-rounded ball out of the tablespoon measure  and then use your hands to form a tightly packed ball of truffle goodness. Be gentle with them  I found that they fall apart if you try to roll them into balls. It is best to squish them with your hand into perfect little spheres. Form truffles until you use up all the mixture. The last bit that was not enough for a truffle went straight into my mouth. :) If you choose to  gently roll the truffles in the toppings of your choice. I had some turtle crunch sprinkles  unsweetened coconut flakes  and extra cocoa powder.
