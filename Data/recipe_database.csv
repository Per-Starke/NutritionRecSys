Add additional coconut flour if the peanut mixture is too soft  it should be pliable and easy to form into shapes with your hands.Using a tablespoon or ice cream scoop  drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Form into balls and flatten each ball slightly with your fingers. Place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes until firm.Melt the chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat  stirring often  until melted. Let cool for a few minutes and then dip each of the frozen peanut butter pieces into the chocolate to coat completely. Using a fork is a good way to do this and be sure to work quickly. Transfer each peanut butter cup back to the baking sheet and return to the freezer. Sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt if desired. Chill until set  about 1 hour or more. These will keep well in the freezer for several days  if they last that long.Note: You can make a half batch instead  but these are so good  you won't want to do that  especially as they keep so well. , 53.79, 1.84, 9.22, 45.67, 2.11, 100.0, 0.0
