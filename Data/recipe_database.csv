Using a food processor  pulse cauliflower florets until they resemble rice or couscous. You should end up with around four cups of  cauliflower rice.  Heat 1T butter and 1T oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and the white and light green pieces of scallion. Sauté about a minute. Add the cauliflower to the pan. Stir to coat with oil  then spread out in pan and let sit; you want it cook a bit and to caramelize (get a bit brown)  which will bring out the sweetness. After a couple of minutes  stir and spread out again. Add cold rice (it separates easily  so it won't clump up during cooking)  plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and  again  spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom. Let it sit for about two minutes—so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy. Add the peas and broccoli and stir again. Drizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat. Add chopped scallion tops and toss.I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw  chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.Season to taste with salt and  if you'd like  more soy sauce. Keep in mind that if you're serving this with something salty and saucy (ie. teriyaki chicken) you may want to hold off on adding too much salt to the fried rice.,40.03,100.0,26.17,46.7,43.06,54.69,0.0,

You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps. Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together. Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot  add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two  or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir. Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer  just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler. To assemble the wraps  place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower  zucchini noodles  red pepper  and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up. Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce. These wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made.

Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds then let the herbs seep in the warm olive oil while you prepare the artichokes.Prepare a large pot with an inch of water at the bottom and a steamer rack. Prepare the artichokes. Have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation  use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes  rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown. Use a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half. Use a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes. Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil  reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves  cut side down on the steam rack. Cover. Steam for 20 minutes or until you can easily pull off the outer leaves  and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife. The artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes  as you will be cooking them further on the grill.Prepare your grill for direct  high heat. Toss the artichokes in the garlic  lemon and thyme infused oil coating liberally. Sprinkle artichokes with salt and pepper. Place the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates. Cover  and grill for 5 to 10 minutes  until you have nice grill mark on the cut sides of the artichokes.,8.58,7.57,100.0,71.01,6.93,72.34,0.0,
