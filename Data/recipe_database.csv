662670, Swiss Chard Wraps, side dish, 4g, 9g, 11g, dried swiss chard leaves orange cauliflower olive oil garlic salt fresh basil zucchini red bell pepper avocado trader joe's spicy peanut vinaigrette <<instructions>> Chop off the stems of the swiss chard at the point where it meets the leaf. You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps. Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together. Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot  add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two  or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir. Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer  just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler. To assemble the wraps  place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower  zucchini noodles  red pepper  and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up. Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce. These wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made.

Prepare the artichokes. Have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation  use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes  rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown. Use a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half. Use a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes. Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil  reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves  cut side down on the steam rack. Cover. Steam for 20 minutes or until you can easily pull off the outer leaves  and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife. The artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes  as you will be cooking them further on the grill.Prepare your grill for direct  high heat. Toss the artichokes in the garlic  lemon and thyme infused oil coating liberally. Sprinkle artichokes with salt and pepper. Place the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates.

1071602, Sesame Tempeh Bowls, lunch | main course | main dish | dinner, 20g, 69g, 12g, soy sauce water sesame oil brown sugar rice vinegar fresh ginger garlic sesame seeds cornstarch tempeh green onions cooked jasmine rice frozen broccoli florets <<instructions>> Begin by mixing together the sesame sauce. In a medium bowl  stir together the soy sauce  2 Tbsp water  sesame oil  brown sugar  rice vinegar  grated ginger  minced garlic  sesame seeds  and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Set the sauce aside. Cut the brick of tempeh into 8 squares  then cut each square diagonally into a triangle. Turn each triangle on its side and slice it in half so you have two thinner triangles. To achieve the proper tempeh to sauce ratio  you don't want thick pieces. Place the tempeh in a large skillet and add 1/2 cup water. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and let the tempeh simmer until all of the water evaporates (about 5-8 minutes). Flip the tempeh a couple times as it simmers. Once the water has evaporated  turn the heat down to medium and pour in the sesame sauce. The skillet will still be quite hot  so the sauce may begin to thicken immediately. Stir the tempeh in the sauce until the sauce has thickened (1-2 minutes)  then remove it from the heat immediately to prevent further evaporation and thickening. To build the bowls  place one cup of rice in each dish  top with 1/4 of the sesame tempeh  1/4 of the broccoli florets  and a sprinkle of green onion.,100.0,56.29,29.55,60.62,33.6,84.67,12.0,

Next  place the tofu on a flat surface lined with clean kitchen towels or paper towels and pat the sides dry. Transfer to a cutting board. Cut the tofu into -inch cubes and allow them to continue to drain for a few minutes. Meanwhile  in a mixing bowl  combine  cup cornstarch  garlic powder  onion powder  5 spice powder  salt and water until a thick batter forms. Add the tofu and gently toss in the batter until thoroughly coated. Prepare the sauce by mixing together the soy sauce  dark soy sauce  sugar  salt  rice vinegar  sesame oil  2 teaspoons cornstarch and  cup warm water. Stir the sauce until everything is dissolved and combined. Add  cup of peanut oil (or vegetable oil) to a medium to large nonstick frying pan over low heat and add 1 cup of the blanched shelled peanuts. Stir the peanuts in the wok for 5 minutes until they are golden brown. Youll notice the peanuts releasing more oil into the pan.

Let the tofu fry for about 5 minutes  or until the bottoms are browned. Turn the tofu with a spatula (theyll stick together slightly  which may make it easier to flip a bunch of pieces all at once) and let the other side fry for another 5 minutes until the bottom is browned again. At this point  use a spatula to gently separate any tofu pieces that may be sticking together. Set the tofu aside. Use 1  tablespoons of the remaining oil from frying the peanuts and tofu to coat your wok. Add the carrots and stir-fry over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the ginger and dried chili peppers. Toast the ginger and chili peppers for about 20 seconds and add the garlic and scallions. Stir-fry for another 20 seconds. Stir up the pre-mixed sauce with a chopstick or spoon since the cornstarch is likely to have settled  and add the sauce to the wok. Turn the heat up to high  and bring the sauce to a simmer. Once the sauce begins to thicken and reduce  add the tofu and peanuts. Toss the tofu and peanuts into the sauce until everything is coated. Keep stir-frying until the sauce has reduced and is clinging to the tofu and peanuts. At this point  you can stir in the Sichuan peppercorn powder  or you can sprinkle it on top.

519961, Hot and Sour Broiled Tofu (vegan| gluten-free), lunch | main course | main dish | dinner, 34g, 98g, 23g, apple cider vinegar cayenne pepper block extra-firm tofu sour sweet pepper jelly olive oil h0ney <<instructions>> Open tofu package  drain the water  and place tofu in a tofu press and press it for at least one hour  or overnight; refrigerate it if you're pressing overnight. If you don't have a tofu press  wrap the block of tofu in at least 8 paper towels  going round and round  like wrapping a present. Place the wrapped tofu on a rimmed baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top of the tofu and set a heavy cookbook or cast iron pan on top. The weight from the heavy object will cause the tofu to release water and the paper towels will soak it up  and excess water will be contained in the baking sheet. If you notice the paper towels are drenched  unbundle the tofu  and re-wrap as necessary. The most water will release in the first 30 minutes  but there's value to pressing for up to 24 hours for extra-extra chewy tofu. If you plan to press it longer than 3 to 4 hours  you may want to refrigerate it. Meanwhile  make the marinade by whisking together all ingredients in a medium bowl; set aside. Slice the pressed tofu into 12 to 16 thin slices and place slices in the marinade. Very gently spoon the marinade over the slices and turn them to coat evenly. They are fragile  so do this very tenderly and carefully. Allow slices to marinade for at least 15 minutes  or up to 12 hours. You can let them marinate for the day while you're at work which makes for an almost work-free dinner that night; cover and refrigerate if you're marinating for many hours. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. I use my Siplat although technically you're not supposed to broil with it. Do not bake on an unlined baking tray unless you love doing really stubborn with blackened and baked-on bits; set aside. Turn broiler to high and position a rack on the top slot or second slot from the top of the oven. (I use the second slot) Place marinated slices on the prepared tray and make sure there are no puddles of marinade pooling on the tray. It will burn horribly. Wipe off excess with a paper towel if necessary. Reserve extra marinade in a small bowl for dipping after baking. Broil for about 7 minutes  or until edges are just beginning to turn golden and darken  with 9 minutes likely being the maximum. Watch your tofu the entire time  stand in front of the oven and do not leave the kitchen. The tofu can and will burn in a matter of one minute so keep a very  very watchful eye on it. I keep the door closed for the first 4-5 minutes. Then I open the door  rotate the tray  and stand in front of the oven with the door ajar  usually for about 2-3 more minutes. I rotate the tray a few times over those 2-3 minutes to find the sweet spot of my broiler's heat. Allow tofu to cool on tray for about 5 minutes before serving. Tofu will keep airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. I like this tofu both warm or served chilled. Serving Tip - Dice the tofu and combine with rice or quinoa and other diced vegetables like bell peppers  carrots  snow peas  or corn. Toss with the extra marinade or with a simple balsamic and oil-based dressing; serve warm or chilled.,100.0,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,28.36,2.3725,

With juicy flesh and very few fibers  it is ideal for eating raw. The taste is more delicate and milder than that of mature ginger. **Kaffir lime leaf: A thorny bush with aromatic  hourglass-shaped leaves  common to Southeast Asia  kaffir lime has an intense and unique pepper-lime flavor. It is also called  kieffer lime    makrut   or  magrood.  If you can't find it  you can substitute grated lime zest.

Cut the top off the peppers and remove all the seeds and other pulp.  Make sure the insides are completely clean Take a small bowl and add 2 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil. Add 1 tsp of dried parsely and 1/8 tsp of salt. Mix well and use it to baste the peppers.  The peppers should be well oiled in order to roast well Place the oiled peppers in a baking tray.  I place my peppers upside down meaning that the open side is at the bottom. Place the tray in the oven and roast the peppers for 20 min or until the peppers start to blacken slightly.  My oven is old so it takes it about 25 minutes at 500 degrees. Remove the peppers when done and set aside.  Set the oven heat to 400 degrees While the peppers are roasting  cut 4 shallots into thin strips and finely chop 2 garlic cloves Take 1 small zucchini and 1 small yellow squash. Cut them into small pieces and set aside Take 1/2 cup of frozen peas and microwave for 30 seconds.In a medium pan  add 2 tsps of extra virgin olive oil and heat at medium heat.  After 30 seconds  add the garlic and shallots.  Cook until the shallots are browned.  Should take about 5-7 minutes in medium heat Add the chopped zucchini  squash and peas to the pan. Mix well and cook for about 10 minutes on low-to-medium heat.After 10 minutes  add 1 tsp of salt  1 tsp of crushed black pepper  2 tsp of chopped fresh parsley and 1 tsp of chopped fresh rosemary.  You can always go with the dry herbs if you can't find the fresh one. Mix well and keep stirring until the zucchini gets crispy. Add 1 cup of Homestyle Ragu Thick & Hearty Traditional Pasta Sauce.  It is a thick sauce and so perfect for this stuffing recipe Mix well and set aside When the peppers have cooled to the touch  stuff them with the pasta mixture.  I stuffed about 1/2 cup per pepper. Place the stuffed peppers back in the oven which has been heating at 400 degrees.  Roast them for about 7 minutes  then pull them out.,65.85,100.0,42.46,98.41,36.77,53.09,4.1,

Pour the tomatoes out onto a baking sheet with 5 cloves of peeled garlic. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp of olive oil over them along with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Stir them twice during the roasting process.Light the grill or charcoal and allow to heat while you prep the vegetables. Wash and slice the rest of the vegetables. Only slice them into two or three large chunks so they do not fall into the grill (see photo below). I cut the squash  onion and bell pepper into two pieces each and the eggplant into medallions about 1 inch thick. Place the sliced vegetables onto another baking sheet and sprinkle with the remaining 3 Tbsp of olive oil and another pinch of salt and pepper. Using your hands mix them all up until they are all well coated in the oil. The eggplant will soak the oil up like a sponge so to make sure it is coated you can wipe it on the tray where oil has dripped off of the other vegetables.Grill the vegetables until they are slightly charred on the outside and slightly soft but not mushy (see photos below). Return them to the tray and allow them to cool.While the vegetables are cooling  begin boiling the pasta according to the directions on the box. While the pasta is boiling  chop the grilled vegetables into small  bite-sized pieces. Coarsely chop about  bunch of flat leaf parsley.After the pasta has been cooked and drained  allow it to cool slightly.

You can add a splash of water  as needed  to help prevent the vegetables from sticking to the bottom of the pan. The vegetables will probably fill the pan at first  but will shrink down as they cook! Prepare the sauce in a medium bowl. Add in the peanut butter  tamari  sriracha  lime juice  sesame oil  maple syrup  ginger  and garlic. Use a whisk to stir them together  then add water 1 tablespoon at a time  as needed  to help thin the sauce. I usually use 2 tablespoons of water to get a pour-able consistency. Add the drained noodles to the pan of sauteed vegetables  along with the carrots  cilantro  and peanut sauce. Toss well to coat everything in the sauce  and make sure everything is heated through. Serve warm  with the chopped green onions on top. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days  and reheated in a pan until warm again.,84.61,100.0,36.04,60.84,44.09,90.83,45.745,

Knead until well incorporated. If your mixture is too wet  add a little more flour. Form into 10 patties. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes  flipping halfway through  until firm and just beginning to brown. You can eat them just like this  but they get extra yummy if you panfry them in a little sesame oil after you bake them  just to get a little golden crispy crust! Serving Suggestion You can eat this patty warm or cold. I like it all by itself  but it’s also super yummy in a pita or on flatbread. It’s also good on a wheat bun with a schmear of hummus or tzatziki sauce.

Place the squash on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and roast for 15 minutes.Meanwhile  place the apples  leeks  garlic and thyme in the bowl and mix well with the other 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of broth or a drizzle of oil. Add this mixture to the cookie sheet with the roasted squash  mix around to incorporate and roast for 30 minutes.While the vegetable mixture is roasting  place the rice  pumpkin seeds and the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt into a food processor.

Place the mixture into a bowl  and put it in the fridge for at least 20 minutes; an hour is best. Making this the day before and letting it sit overnight is optimal. This helps all flavors marinate and leads to a sturdier burger.To cook  shape the mixture into patties. If youre not using a nonstick pan  then you may want to prepare the pan by brushing it with a tad of oil to avoid sticking. Place the patties in a pan on the stove top over medium heat for 15 minutes on each side. Pans and stove tops vary  so begin to check the patties at 10 minutes. If you try to slide your spatula under a patty and it wont give  then it isnt ready and needs to cook longer.You can also bake the patties on a parchment-lined cookie sheet at 375F (191C) for about 20 to 25 minutes on each side. Allow the patties to cool and set for 5 to 7 minutes. Serve on buns with the Lemon Thyme Mayo and toppings of your choice.Kids: Make patties into a smaller slider size or into nuggets.

Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the onion with a big pinch of salt until soft  around 5 mins. Add the garlic and spices and cook for 2 mins more  then set aside. Blitz the tofu with the cashews in a blender  then tip in the sweet potato and fried onions. Season and blitz again until combined. Shape into four burger patties and set aside in the fridge on a lined baking tray while you make the slaw. Make the slaw by combining the ingredients in a bowl  then set aside until needed. When youre ready to fry the patties  mix the mustard with the soy milk in one bowl  then mix the remaining coating ingredients in another bowl.

Pour the vegetable oil into a large frying pan over a medium-high heat - you want the oil to come about 2cm up the side of the pan. Once hot  use a spatula to carefully add the patties and gently fry for 1 min on each side until crispy  then leave to drain on kitchen paper.

I use a coffee grinder for this. In a mixing bowl  crumble the tofu and mix well with the spice mixture so that the herbs are well infused with the tofu. Let sit for the flavors to meld. In a microwave-safe bowl  mix together the TVP granules and the broth  cover tightly with plastic wrap  and microwave for 5 to 6 minutes.

When cool enough to handle  add the TVP to the tofu mixture  then add the minced garlic  flaxseed mixture  sunflower seeds  pumpkin seeds  and salt and pepper to taste. Mix with your hands until all the ingredients are very well incorporated. The mixture will be nice and smooth  and should form lovely burgers. Shape into 6 patties. Refrigerate until ready to cook  although refrigeration isn’t necessary if you plan on cooking them right away. I recommend baking these rather than frying. It just seems that this burger is too healthy to fry. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C  or gas mark and line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone baking mat. Bake  covered with a foil tent  for 15 minutes per side.

You can chop as finely as you can or leave everything a bit coarse so you’ll have more texture in your burgers. Place the chopped mushrooms  bell peppers  carrot  onion  garlic and panko in a mixing bowl. Stir to combine. Mix the chickpea flour with 2 tbsps. of water to make a paste. Stir into the vegetables and mushrooms then season the mixture with salt and pepper.Divide the mixture into two portions. Form each portion into a patty. Keep the patties thin. You’ll get more crunch out of your burgers that way.Coat the bottom of the frying pan with vegetable cooking oil. Coat. Generously. Not brush but coat. You need the oil to make sure that the burgers will form a crust on the outside. If you have a large frying pan  you can cook the patties at the same time. Otherwise  cook them one by one.Fry the patties over medium heat until nicely browned underneath. Then  flip carefully to brown the other side. You may want to drizzle another tablespoonful of oil into the pan after flipping so that the top will get enough oil to allow it to brown well too. Important: Do not flip until the underside is well-browned because without the browned and firm crust  the patties are really soft and if flipped too early they will break apart. Brush your bread with whatever spread you like. I used hummus with tahini. Lay some greens on the bread then position the patty. Cover with another piece of bread. And enjoy.These vegan mushroom burgers are really tasty. It’s best not to chop the mushrooms and vegetables too finely to enjoy good texture.One caveat  though. The inside of the burgers will still be soft. So  it’s best to make really thin patties so that  with both sides of the burgers well browned and crisp  the soft part becomes negligible.,23.9,82.08,18.56,27.37,65.36,100.0,0.093,

I process each ingredient individually to achieve the best texture. Next add half of the cooked lentils to the food processor and pulse until they appear slightly mashed  then transfer them to the bowl along with the remaining lentils. Once you have all of the vegetables  lentils  nuts and seeds in the bowl  add the breadcrumbs  herbs  and salt. In a small bowl  combine the beaten egg with the tomato paste and the Worcestershire. Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with vegetables and lentils and stir everything together. Sprinkle in the flour a little at a time as you continue to stir. If the mixture seems too wet  add more flour as needed. If you have time  refrigerating the mixture for about 30 minutes also helps dry out some of the moisture. Form eight individual patties with your hands  making sure to keep them somewhat flat with rounded edges. They will hold together better if they arent too big or thick. At this point you can refrigerate them until you are ready to cook (for up to 2-3 days) or cook them right away. When youre ready to cook them  start by warming the olive oil over medium-heat in a skillet for at least five minutes. Once the skillet is thoroughly heated  cook the burgers on each side for about 5-6 minutes. I like the push the edges of the burger to the side of the pan as I cook them to make sure they are cooked on the sides as well.

Put them in a bowl and add the flour.When the lentils finish cooking  drain any excess water and add them to the bowl with the carrots. Mash them slightly  and add flour (and some water if you need to) to get them to the point where they’ll stick together. Then season with the spices  salt and pepper. You might find they hold together better if you put the mixture in the fridge or freezer for 30 minutes to chill. Heat a pan to medium and form the lentil mix into burger shapes. Add a bit of oil to the pan and cook the burgers  about 10 minutes on the first side. Flip  and cook another 5-7 minutes.

Carefully squeeze the potato to make sure it is soft all the way through. If it is not  microwave longer  in one minute increments  until it is soft all the way through (mine took 8 minutes).Took cook it in the oven: heat the oven to 400 degrees and then bake the potato for 45-60 minutes  or until it is soft all the way through (either directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet).While the sweet potato is cooling  prepare the rest of the ingredients. Place the frozen corn in a large bowl. Drain and rinse the black beans. Allow as much excess water to drain away as possible  and then add them to the bowl with the corn. Roughly chop the cilantro leaves and then add them to the bowl  along with half of the cornmeal (1/4 cup)  garlic powder  cumin  and salt. Take one chipotle pepper out of the can  mince it  and then add it to the bowl along with about one teaspoon of the adobo sauce from the can.Once the sweet potato is cool enough to handle  scoop out the flesh and add it to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. Stir everything together and then either use a potato masher or the back of a fork to slightly mash the beans. Cover and chill the mixture for 30 minutes to allow the cornmeal to absorb some of the moisture.Divide the sweet potato mixture into four (or six) portions and shape each into a patty  approximately  inch thick. Use the remaining  cup of cornmeal to coat the outside of the patties. This will provide a nice crunch to the burger.To cook the patties in a skillet  heat  tablespoon of vegetable oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over a medium flame. When the oil is hot (it should look wavy on the surface)  add two of the patties. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side or until the patties are golden brown. Add more oil and cook the remaining two patties. Remember to turn the patties carefully as they are quite soft and can fall apart.OR...To cook the patties in the oven  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and then coat lightly with non-stick spray. Place the patties on the foil and then spritz the top of the patties lightly with non-stick spray (this will help it crisp up). Bake for 25 minutes  or until the patties are heated through and the bottoms are golden brown. Spread one tablespoon of mayonnaise on each bun and top with a chipotle sweet potato patty. Slice the avocado and place  of the slices on top of each burger. Top with extra cilantro leaves  if desired.,61.1,9.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,112.5,

Set aside and allow to cool.Using a food processor  finely chop the onion  carrots  garlic  walnuts and sunflower seeds then transfer to a large bowl. I prefer to process each ingredient individually to achieve the best texture.Next add the cooked lentils to the food processor and pulse until they appear slightly pureed  then transfer them to the bowl as well. *Be careful not to over process the lentils. You dont want them to turn to mush--there should still be some shape to at least half of them. See picture in the post as an example.Once you have all of the vegetables  lentils  nuts and seeds in the bowl  add the sweet potato  breadcrumbs  herbs/paprika/salt&pepper  and the flax meal then stir everything together.Next pour in the barbeque sauce and the egg or flax egg and stir until well-combined. Sprinkle in the flour a little at a time as you continue to stir. If the mixture seems too wet  add more flour as needed.Form eight individual patties with your hands  making sure to keep them somewhat flat with rounded edges and somewhat smaller than the bun. They will hold together better if they arent too thick or too big. At this point you can refrigerate them until you are ready to cook (for up to 2-3 days) or cook them right away.When youre ready to cook them  start by warming the olive oil over medium-heat in a skillet for at least five minutes. Once the skillet is thoroughly heated  cook the burgers on each side for about 5-6 minutes. I like the push the edges of the burger to the side of the pan as I cook them to make sure they are cooked on the sides as well.

Place it cut-sides down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicon baking mat. Bake for 25 minutes or until the eggplant is completely sunken in and tender. Remove to a shallow dish and allow to cool completely. (You can do this even several days in advance and store in a covered container in the refrigerator.) Once the eggplant is cool  discard any liquid that has accumulated and scrape the flesh from the peel. Place the pulp in a food processor and pulse a few times to make a coarse puree. Transfer to a medium-sized bowl and add the remaining ingredients. Mix very well and allow to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicon baking mat. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Once it’s hot  wipe or spray it with a little pan spray or canola oil. Wet your hands and form eggplant mixture into patties about 3 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. (You can also form the burgers by spooning the mixture into the pan and using the back of a spoon to shape it into patties.) Cook three or four at a time until lightly browned and then carefully flip over and brown the other side. Remove with a spatula and place each burger on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes  until burgers are cooked through. Serve with traditional hamburger condiments or with Spicy Onion-Pepper Relish.,35.95,100.0,19.95,37.63,38.62,55.2,0.595,

Bring to a boil  reduce to a simmer  and cook for 10-15 minutes  until softened. Drain excess water and transfer to a bowl mixing bowl.You can cook the millet at the same time as the lentils  or use the same pan after the lentils are cooked. Pour the millet into a saucepan over medium heat  and toast for about 5 minutes  until lightly golden. Pour in 1 cup water and ¼ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil  then reduce heat to low  cover  and simmer for 15 minutes  until most of the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes. All of the water should be absorbed at this point. Pour the millet into the bowl with the lentils. Heat ½ tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds)  then add the onions and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook until the onions are starting to soften  then add the green pepper. Cook for 3-5 minutes  until the green pepper is softened as well. Pour the stir-fried vegetables into the bowl with the lentils and millet  and refrigerate until ingredients are completely cool (at least 30 minutes).Preheat oven to 35 Add all remaining ingredients except the flour and egg (flax or chicken egg) to the bowl with the chilled lentils  millet  and veggies. Stir until the spices are incorporated fully into the mixture  then taste and adjust seasoning to your liking. Mix in the flour  followed by the egg.Shape ½ cup of the mixture into a patty  packing tight with your hands so it sticks together well. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining patties (you should end up with 7). Bake for 10-12 minutes on each side. After they're done baking  let them sit on the baking sheet for a couple minutes before moving - this will allow them to set up more.You can eat them as-is  but I like to pan fry them to make the outside a little crispy and golden. To do so  just use ½ teaspoon olive oil for each side of each patty (so 1 teaspoon total for each patty). Fry over medium heat for about 3 minutes on each side. Serve on buns (gluten free  if desired)  with your favorite toppings - I like avocado  chopped radicchio  hot sauce  and hummus (bean on bean on bean  I know).,57.49,100.0,12.74,41.85,29.91,91.4,90.2975,

Place sweet potato on a small plan lined with foil and bake in the oven for 30-45 minutes or until fork tender.While sweet potato is cooking  cook the wild rice by adding 1 cup water and wild rice to a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil  then cover  reduce heat to low and simmer for 30-40 minutes or until tender. Add cooked sweet potato (not the skin) and chickpeas to a large bowl; mash with a fork or potato masher. (Alternatively you can use a food processor and pulse them until somewhat  but not completely smooth.) Next stir in cooked wild rice  curry powder  cumin and garlic powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Then stir in breadcrumbs (or oat flour)  cranberries and pecans  if using. The pecans add a lovely flavor  but aren't necessary. Shape mixture into six patties. It's easier to shape and cook the patties when they are cold  so if you'd like you can keep the mixture in the fridge until cold then form patties (I recommend doing it this way!). Heat coconut oil over medium heat in a large pan. Once oil is hot  add patties and cook for about 7-9 minutes  then VERY carefully flip. Cook for an additional 7-9 minutes on the other side  adding more oil to the pan if necessary. Serve on their own or in a bun! I love mine with avocado & arugula.

I was only making one so I used the whole wedge  I can see sharing the wedge across 2 burgers but since I only had one  I also topped the onion.Close the grill and let the cheese warm up. It’s not going to melt since it’s more a cream cheese style cheese than a slice but it will still warm and get squishier.At this time I also toasted my “bun” on the grill. Remove the eggplant and onion and stack with some spinach leaves on the English muffin.I severed with a side of roasted Brussels sprouts.

All you need is vodka or rum  vanilla simple syrup  fresh brewed coffee and a jar or bottle  and this popular spirit is yours to gift or drink! The holiday season is upon us and its time to get your gift list in order for everyone in your life. If youre anything like me  then some people on your list are really  really easy to buy for  while others are just well  not. I consider myself to be a pretty good gift giver  but some people are just puzzles! One side of my family has tried to combat the inevitable  What do I buy him/her? dilemma by organizing a big Secret Santa every year in lieu of giving each person a gift. There are usually at least 16 people at our Christmas celebration  so it can be hard on the wallet to buy a unique gift for every single person. Instead  we draw names and all buy our Secret Santa one bigger gift with a larger budget. Its really fun to think about your assigned giftee and get them something really thoughtful. Sometimes it involves asking around for ideas or a list  but ultimately its so great to see the look on their face when youve nailed it! Before we started our Secret Santa tradition  I used to try to make everyone (even friends outside my family) a homemade gift to save some cash as well as shopping time. Ive made my fair share of hot cocoa mixes  chocolate truffles  painted wooden spoons and airplane cocktail kits and theyre always a big hit. (It still makes me grin when I see those wooden spoons in use in my family members kitchens!) One thing Im really into right now is homemade liqueurs. Ive shown you how to make homemade Irish cream liqueur  homemade honey whiskey and homemade spiced rum. Any of these would make great holiday gifts  but Ive got one more recipe to throw at you today: Homemade Coffee Liqueur. If you have any Tia Maria or Kahlua fans on your list  (or even white russian or black russian aficionados!) this recipe is for you. Sweet and caffeinated  this vodka- or rum-based liqueur is great for sipping neat or on the rocks  but its also lovely stirred into coffee cocktails like this Tiramisu Martini. You can also use it in desserts. It would be amazing baked into these Kahlua Cupcakes  this Mocha Coffee Cake or in this Peppermint Cookie Mudslide. All you need to make Homemade Coffee Liqueur is vodka  cold brew coffee  vanilla extract and some simple syrup. Thats it! Let it sit for three days before consuming  and youve got yourself a gift any coffee addict would love! Enjoy! What kind of vodka should I buy? I stand by the old adage that you should use the best ingredients you can afford. Personally  I find a cheap vodka tastes cheap  but it can actually be quite sippable if you are willing to spend a little more. Alternatively  you can use a light rum. Rum can have a slightly sweeter or smokier flavor  but it really comes down to personal preference. Are you tired of the dinner routine? Stuck in a rut or looking for fun new recipes to try?

I used coconut oil spray. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a medium mixing bowl  whisk together the oat flour  almond flour  tapioca flour  baking soda  and salt. In a separate bowl or liquid measuring cup  combine the melted chocolate  maple syrup  applesauce  coffee  and vanilla extract. Make sure all of the ingredients are warm or room temperature so the chocolate doesn’t seize up. Whisk the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients  until a smooth batter forms. Immediately fill each donut cavity very well  almost to the top. This will help give you nice and fluffy donuts. Bake for 11 to 13 minutes  or until firm and fluffy to the touch. Let cool almost completely before removing from the pan. Clean the pan and repeat with the rest of the batter. It may have thickened while the other donuts baked – that’s okay  just press it into place. Bake and cool. For the glaze In a medium saucepan or microwavable bowl  combine the chocolate  coconut milk  and coffee. If heating over the stove  heat over medium-low  stirring frequently until completely melted and smooth. If heating in the microwave  heat in 20-second increments  stirring between each  until smooth. Put the melted chocolate in a shallow bowl a little bit wider than the donuts are big. Dunk each of the cooled donuts into the glaze. If they seem too delicate to dip  you can also pour or drizzle the chocolate on top. While the chocolate is cooling  sprinkle with cacao nibs and crushed coffee beans. To store Keep them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. After that  move to the fridge for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them  pre- or post-glaze  in an airtight container for up to 3 months.,42.62,1.92,9.01,14.83,5.76,100.0,0.0,

Pour the filling into the tart shells and stick them back in the fridge to firm up.  I would give them a good 4 hours to set.

1007514, Healthy Nibbles & Bits, side dish, 7g, 50g, 15g, artichokes cornstarch garlic powder black ground pepper lemons olive oil mandarin orange juice orange zest red pepper flakes rice vinegar salt sugar vegetable broth water water <<instructions>> Fill a large bowl with cold water. Squeeze the juice of 1 lemon into the bowl of water and toss the lemon wedges into the bowl of water. Set the bowl aside. If your artichoke comes with the stems attached  trim the stem so that you have about 1 1/2 inches of stem remaining. Peel off any small leaves on the stem and around the base of the artichoke. With a paring knife or vegetable peeler  peel off the outer skin of the stem. Squeeze lemon juice on the stem and rub it around. Using a sharp knife  cut off the top 1/3 portion of an artichoke. Then  using kitchen sheers  trim off the tips of the remaining leaves to remove the thorns. Squeeze the juice from a lemon wedge over the cut side to keep the artichoke from browning. Place the artichoke on the cutting board  cut side down  so that the stem is sticking up. Slice the artichoke down the middle. Squeeze lemon juice all over each half. You can also rub the lemon wedges on the artichokes. Use a knife or spoon to scoop out the fuzzy choke. Be careful because the leaves right above the choke may be thorny. If they are  use kitchen shears to cut them off. Squeeze more lemon juice into the cavity where the choke once was. Place the artichokes into the bowl of water. Repeat with the other artichoke. Heat a large pan with the olive oil over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot  add the artichokes to the pan  cut side down. Cook the artichokes for about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the vegetable broth into the pan. There should be enough broth in the pan so that it goes up the sides of the artichoke by about 1/2 inch. Bring the broth to boil  then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pan with a lid and let the artichokes cook for 20 to 25 minutes. The artichokes are done when a knife easily slices down the base of the artichoke  an indication that the artichoke heart is tender. Transfer the artichokes to a plate. Pour the broth into a bowl. Return 1/3 cup of broth to the pan. Add the mandarin orange juice  mandarin orange zest  rice vinegar  sugar  salt  red pepper flakes  garlic powder  and black pepper to the pan. Stir to combine the ingredients. Heat the sauce over medium-high heat. Once the liquids start to boil  mix 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Pour the slurry into the pan and stir. The cornstarch helps thicken the sauce. Let the sauce cook for another 1 to 2 minutes and turn off the heat. Drizzle some of the sauce over the artichokes and save the rest for dipping. The tender flesh on the insides of the artichoke are edible!

1690829, Healthy Vegan Butter Tarts, dessert, 5g, 51g, 19g, whole wheat spelt flour sea salt coconut oil light agave nectar raisins brown rice syrup light agave nectar non-gmo cornstarch coconut oil vanilla extract brandy ground chia seeds baking powder <<instructions>> Preheat your oven to 325ºF (165C). Lightly grease 8 individual tart pans (I used 3-inch or 7.5 cm pans with removable bottoms). If you’re using solid pans (without removable bottoms)  it’s worth lining these with parchment paper rounds and then greasing the rounds  as the bottoms may stick to the pan otherwise. In a medium bowl  sift the flour and salt. In a small bowl  melt the ½ cup (120 ml) coconut oil and then whisk in the agave nectar until combined. Pour the coconut-agave mixture over the flour mixture and toss with a fork until it comes together. Knead with your hands just until the wet ingredients are well incorporated. You should have a very soft dough that just holds its shape (if dough is really too soft  sprinkle more flour  about 1 tablespoon or 15 mL at a time  until you reach a just barely firm texture–this dough should be very soft!). Divide dough into 8 equal portions among the tart pans. Dust your hands with flour. Beginning with the sides of the tart pans  press the dough evenly to cover each pan; dust hands with flour periodically to prevent the dough from sticking. Place the tart pans on a cookie sheet and bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the crust is just starting to puff up. Remove from oven and sprinkle about ½ tablespoon (7.5 mL) of the raisins in the bottom of each shell (4 to 6 raisins). In a medium bowl  whisk together the brown rice syrup and agave nectar with the cornstarch until the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the melted 2 tablespoons (30 mL) coconut oil  vanilla  brandy and chia seeds (be sure there are no little lumps of chia left in the mixture). Add the baking powder last and mix quickly just to blend. Divide the mixture equally among the tart pans so the pans are about ¾ full  or filling is almost even with the top of the crusts (you may have a bit of filling left over–it makes a nice topping over ice cream or pancakes). Bake 25 for 30 minutes in preheated oven  turning about halfway through to ensure even baking. The tarts are ready when the filling appears foamy on top and bubbles a little onto the sides of crust in the pans. It will begin to brown on top but will still appear quite liquid when you jiggle the pans; this is as it should be. Remove the tarts carefully from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature  then refrigerate until firm. These can be eaten cold or at room temperature; for the latter  chill first and then return to room temperature. Store  covered  in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
