Using a food processor  pulse cauliflower florets until they resemble rice or couscous. You should end up with around four cups of  cauliflower rice.  Heat 1T butter and 1T oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and the white and light green pieces of scallion. Sauté about a minute. Add the cauliflower to the pan. Stir to coat with oil  then spread out in pan and let sit; you want it cook a bit and to caramelize (get a bit brown)  which will bring out the sweetness. After a couple of minutes  stir and spread out again. Add cold rice (it separates easily  so it won't clump up during cooking)  plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and  again  spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom. Let it sit for about two minutes—so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy. Add the peas and broccoli and stir again. Drizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat. Add chopped scallion tops and toss.I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw  chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.Season to taste with salt and  if you'd like  more soy sauce. Keep in mind that if you're serving this with something salty and saucy (ie. teriyaki chicken) you may want to hold off on adding too much salt to the fried rice.,40.03,100.0,26.17,46.7,43.06,54.69,0.0,

You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps. Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together. Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot  add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two  or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir. Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer  just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler. To assemble the wraps  place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower  zucchini noodles  red pepper  and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up. Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce. These wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made.

Prepare the artichokes. Have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation  use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes  rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown. Use a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half. Use a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes. Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil  reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves  cut side down on the steam rack. Cover. Steam for 20 minutes or until you can easily pull off the outer leaves  and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife. The artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes  as you will be cooking them further on the grill.Prepare your grill for direct  high heat. Toss the artichokes in the garlic  lemon and thyme infused oil coating liberally. Sprinkle artichokes with salt and pepper. Place the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates.

Set the sauce aside. Cut the brick of tempeh into 8 squares  then cut each square diagonally into a triangle. Turn each triangle on its side and slice it in half so you have two thinner triangles. To achieve the proper tempeh to sauce ratio  you don't want thick pieces. Place the tempeh in a large skillet and add 1/2 cup water. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and let the tempeh simmer until all of the water evaporates (about 5-8 minutes). Flip the tempeh a couple times as it simmers. Once the water has evaporated  turn the heat down to medium and pour in the sesame sauce. The skillet will still be quite hot  so the sauce may begin to thicken immediately. Stir the tempeh in the sauce until the sauce has thickened (1-2 minutes)  then remove it from the heat immediately to prevent further evaporation and thickening. To build the bowls  place one cup of rice in each dish  top with 1/4 of the sesame tempeh  1/4 of the broccoli florets  and a sprinkle of green onion.,100.0,56.29,29.55,60.62,33.6,84.67,12.0,

In a large stockpot  cook the noodles (or rice or grains) according to the package instructions. Drain in a colander  then rinse with cold water  and drizzle with a splash of oil (or I like to use toasted sesame oil)  and toss until the noodles are evenly coated.  This will help prevent them from sticking.  Set aside. Cook the broth.  Meanwhile  get your broth going. Heat oil in a separate large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add onion and saut for 5 minutes  stirring occasionally. Add garlic and saut for 1 more minute  stirring occasionally.  Then add in the veggie stock  coconut milk  curry paste and ginger  and stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the broth reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low  cover and simmer until ready to use.  Taste and season with salt and pepper  as needed.  Meanwhile Cook your proteins (if using).  As I mentioned above  you can either cook your protein actually in the broth  or separately (in the oven  on the stove  or in the Instant Pot  depending on your protein) and then add it in at the end. Cook your veggies.  You also have the choice of cooking your veggies actually in the broth  or separately (in the oven  on the stove  or in the Instant Pot  depending on your veggies).

At this point  use a spatula to gently separate any tofu pieces that may be sticking together. Set the tofu aside. Use 1  tablespoons of the remaining oil from frying the peanuts and tofu to coat your wok. Add the carrots and stir-fry over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the ginger and dried chili peppers. Toast the ginger and chili peppers for about 20 seconds and add the garlic and scallions. Stir-fry for another 20 seconds. Stir up the pre-mixed sauce with a chopstick or spoon since the cornstarch is likely to have settled  and add the sauce to the wok. Turn the heat up to high  and bring the sauce to a simmer. Once the sauce begins to thicken and reduce  add the tofu and peanuts. Toss the tofu and peanuts into the sauce until everything is coated. Keep stir-frying until the sauce has reduced and is clinging to the tofu and peanuts. At this point  you can stir in the Sichuan peppercorn powder  or you can sprinkle it on top.

519961, Hot and Sour Broiled Tofu (vegan| gluten-free), lunch | main course | main dish | dinner, 34g, 98g, 23g, apple cider vinegar cayenne pepper block extra-firm tofu sour sweet pepper jelly olive oil h0ney <<instructions>> Open tofu package  drain the water  and place tofu in a tofu press and press it for at least one hour  or overnight; refrigerate it if you're pressing overnight. If you don't have a tofu press  wrap the block of tofu in at least 8 paper towels  going round and round  like wrapping a present. Place the wrapped tofu on a rimmed baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top of the tofu and set a heavy cookbook or cast iron pan on top. The weight from the heavy object will cause the tofu to release water and the paper towels will soak it up  and excess water will be contained in the baking sheet. If you notice the paper towels are drenched  unbundle the tofu  and re-wrap as necessary. The most water will release in the first 30 minutes  but there's value to pressing for up to 24 hours for extra-extra chewy tofu. If you plan to press it longer than 3 to 4 hours  you may want to refrigerate it. Meanwhile  make the marinade by whisking together all ingredients in a medium bowl; set aside. Slice the pressed tofu into 12 to 16 thin slices and place slices in the marinade. Very gently spoon the marinade over the slices and turn them to coat evenly. They are fragile  so do this very tenderly and carefully. Allow slices to marinade for at least 15 minutes  or up to 12 hours. You can let them marinate for the day while you're at work which makes for an almost work-free dinner that night; cover and refrigerate if you're marinating for many hours. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. I use my Siplat although technically you're not supposed to broil with it. Do not bake on an unlined baking tray unless you love doing really stubborn with blackened and baked-on bits; set aside. Turn broiler to high and position a rack on the top slot or second slot from the top of the oven. (I use the second slot) Place marinated slices on the prepared tray and make sure there are no puddles of marinade pooling on the tray. It will burn horribly. Wipe off excess with a paper towel if necessary. Reserve extra marinade in a small bowl for dipping after baking. Broil for about 7 minutes  or until edges are just beginning to turn golden and darken  with 9 minutes likely being the maximum. Watch your tofu the entire time  stand in front of the oven and do not leave the kitchen. The tofu can and will burn in a matter of one minute so keep a very  very watchful eye on it. I keep the door closed for the first 4-5 minutes. Then I open the door  rotate the tray  and stand in front of the oven with the door ajar  usually for about 2-3 more minutes. I rotate the tray a few times over those 2-3 minutes to find the sweet spot of my broiler's heat. Allow tofu to cool on tray for about 5 minutes before serving. Tofu will keep airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. I like this tofu both warm or served chilled. Serving Tip - Dice the tofu and combine with rice or quinoa and other diced vegetables like bell peppers  carrots  snow peas  or corn. Toss with the extra marinade or with a simple balsamic and oil-based dressing; serve warm or chilled.,100.0,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,28.36,2.3725,
