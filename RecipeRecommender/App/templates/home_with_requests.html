        This recipe recommender gets to know your taste by analyzing ratings you provide
        for recipes you already know, and with each new recipe you try and rate, you'll get even better recommendations.

        <span> But that's not all there is!</span>

        You can also provide macronutrient goals for a meal, and we'll recommend something that suits both
        taste and macronutrients.
