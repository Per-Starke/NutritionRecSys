## Welcome & Introduction

Welcome to the Recipe Recommender. 
It's an online software tool that makes personalized recipe recommendations that match your taste.  
It does that by analyzing ratings you provide for recipes.  
You can furthermore specify meal types and macronutrients you are looking for, and you'll get recommendations suiting 
your requirements.  
Optionally, it allows working together with a nutrition coach.  
I developed this software in the scope of my Bachelor Thesis in order to find out which recommendation algorithm
performs best at matching your taste and recommend recipes that are to your liking.  
I hope you enjoy using the Recipe Recommender!

## Get started

At the top, you see the navigation, your user-id and a logout-button.  
As the Recipe Recommender needs you to provide a few ratings to analyze your taste before being able to recommend
recipes for you, you need to rate 10 recipes before really getting started.  
That's why every button currently will redirect you to this page, showing you a random recipe.  
Click on the recipe title, which will open the recipe page in a new tab. You can now either really cook this recipe
if you want, or carefully look at the image, ingredients, preparation instructions and macronutrients.   
Then, please give a rating of 1-5 stars to this recipe, and submit.  
You can close the tab, reload this page, and you'll see a new recipe as well as the updated amount of recipes you 
still need to rate.  
Once you are done with rating 10 recipes, you are ready to get personalized recipe recommendations.  
  
The first navigation button leads you to the home-page, that just includes some short information.  
If you work together with a coach, the coach can sent you a request for working with you.   
You will see that request here and can accept or decline it.   
If you accept, the coach can see your recommendations, enter required nutrients and can give ratings in your name.
