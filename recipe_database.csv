Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds then let the herbs seep in the warm olive oil while you prepare the artichokes.Prepare a large pot with an inch of water at the bottom and a steamer rack. Prepare the artichokes. Have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation  use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes  rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown. Use a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half. Use a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes. Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil  reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves  cut side down on the steam rack. Cover. Steam for 20 minutes or until you can easily pull off the outer leaves  and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife. The artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes  as you will be cooking them further on the grill.Prepare your grill for direct  high heat. Toss the artichokes in the garlic  lemon and thyme infused oil coating liberally. Sprinkle artichokes with salt and pepper. Place the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates.

The water should be hot to the touch but not hot enough to burn you. Process the almonds in a food processor until coarse almond meal is formed. Add the pecans and process until they are ground up into a coarse meal as well. Drain the dates and use your hand to squeeze out excess water. Add the drained dates  cocoa powder  vanilla extract  agave nectar  and salt to the food processor. Process until a smooth paste forms. Use a tablespoon measure to help you form the truffles. Pack a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the tablespoon measure  really pack it in there. Use your fingers to slide the half-rounded ball out of the tablespoon measure  and then use your hands to form a tightly packed ball of truffle goodness. Be gentle with them  I found that they fall apart if you try to roll them into balls. It is best to squish them with your hand into perfect little spheres. Form truffles until you use up all the mixture. The last bit that was not enough for a truffle went straight into my mouth. :) If you choose to  gently roll the truffles in the toppings of your choice. I had some turtle crunch sprinkles  unsweetened coconut flakes  and extra cocoa powder. The cocoa powder definitely gives the the truffles an extra dark chocolate kick  so if you dont like the bitterness of the cocoa powder then dont use that as a topping. , 100.0, 21.91, 25.5, 24.45, 28.53, 62.23, 0.0
