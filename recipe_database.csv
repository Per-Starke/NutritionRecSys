Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mats. Cut off both ends of the plantains. Make a cut along the entire length of a plantain  and peel off the skin. Slice each plantain into thin slices. Dont worry if the slices are not perfect. Place the plantains in a medium-sized bowl. Mix in all the other ingredients and stir until everything is well incorporated. Place the plantain slices on the baking sheets in a single layer. Bake for about 15-20 minutes  flipping them at about the 8- or 9-minute mark. Because of the uneven heat distribution in my oven  I also like to swap the baking sheets between the top and bottom racks. Remove the chips from the oven when the edges turn into a nice golden brown color. , 100.0, 4.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 47.25, 1.8
