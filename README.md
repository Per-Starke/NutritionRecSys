# NutritionRecSys
The repo for the software for my bachelor-thesis about a recommender system for use by nutrition coaches, recommending recipes with fitting macronutrients and suitable for the taste of the customer.

## Tools
This software is a web-app, build using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/), the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and a Python framework for recommendation systems called [CaseRecommender](https://github.com/caserec/CaseRecommender)

## Algorithms
Two recommenation algorithms are used, in order to compare them, namely the collaborative filtering algorithm ItemKNN, and a content-based algorithm.
